# Jupyter-Pyplot-Numpy

> Emerging Technologies 4th Year [module](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/)  
> Taught by Dr Ian McLoughlin  
> Solve ten problems using [Jupyter Notebook, Numpy and Pyplot](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/jupyter.html) on the Iris data set  

**Exercise 1 - Get and load data**
Find and download the Iris data set and convert to csv format if needs be.

**Exercise 2 - Write a not about the data set**
Write a short description on the data set.

**Exercise 3 - Create a simple plot**
From the five variables contained in the data set, create a simple plot using sepal length as the x-axis and sepal widt on the y-axis.

**Exercise 4 - Create a more complex plot**
This plot is similar to the plot in exercise 3 but now the setosa data points will be represented by the colour red, versicolor will be represented by the colour green and virginica will be represented by the colour blue.

**Exercise 5 - Use seaborn**
The seaborn library is used to create a scatterplot matrix of all five variables.

**Exercise 6 - Fit a line**
Using a scatterplot the variables petal length and petal width of the whole data set will be represented. Then the best fit line for the data will be shown also in the scatterplot.

**Exercise 7 - Calculate the R-squared value**
Calculate the R-squared value of the line created in exercise 6.

**Exercise 8 - Fit another line**
Numpy is to be used to select only the data where the species is Iris-setosa. Using the variables petal length and petal with, in a scatterplot show the best fit line.

**Exercise 9 - Calculate the R-squared value**
Calculate the R-squared value for the line created in exercise 8.

**Exercise 10 - Use gradient descent**
Gradient descent is to be used to approximte the best fit line for petal length and petal width of the setosa values.
